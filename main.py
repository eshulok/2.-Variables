#Variables are like nicknames for values
#You can assign a value to a variable
temperature = 75
#And then use the variable name in your code
print(temperature)

#You can change the value of the variable
temperature = 100
print(temperature)

#You can use variables for operations
temp_today = 85
temp_yesterday = 79

#How much warmer is it today than yesterday?
print(temp_today - temp_yesterday)

#Tomorrow will be 10 degrees warmer than today
print(temp_today + 10)

#Or if you want to save the value for tomorrow's temperature, create a new variable
temp_tomorrow = temp_today + 10
print(temp_tomorrow)
